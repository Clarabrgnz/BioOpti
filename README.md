## Features

- 📈 **Culture Media Optimization** *(Coming soon)*:  
  Calculate optimal nutrient ratios to maximize organism growth or product yield.

- 🔬 **Enzymatic Reaction Simulation**:  
  Predict enzyme-catalyzed reaction rates under varying conditions (substrate concentration, pH, temperature, inhibitors).
  Easily simulate reactions based on Vmax, Km, inhibition type, and environmental factors.

## Installation

### 🔄 Clone the Repository

First, choose a location on your computer where you want to store the project. For example, you can use your `Documents` folder.
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd ~/Documents  # or any folder where you want to store the project
git clone https://github.com/Clarabrgnz/BioOpti.git
cd BioOpti
```

This will create a folder named `BioOpti` containing all the project files.

---

### 🐍 Create and Activate a Python Environment

Then, create a new environment (feel free to use a different environment name if you prefer):

```bash
conda create -n bioopti python=3.10
conda activate bioopti
```
---

### 📥 Install the Package

Make sure you are inside the `BioOpti` folder and run:

```bash
pip install .
```
---

### 📓 Install JupyterLab

In order to use the Jupyter Notebook for demos or development:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
---

## Development Setup

If you're developing BioOpti or contributing to it, install in Editable Mode with Extra Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```
---

## Running Tests

To run the test suite and check coverage:

```bash
pip install tox
tox
```

### ➞ Simulating Enzymatic Reactions
This example shows how to simulate the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction using known kinetic parameters.
Provide experimental conditions such as substrate concentration, Vmax, Km, pH, temperature, and optional inhibitor information, and the function simulate_reaction_rate will calculate the expected reaction rate (µmol/min) under these specific conditions.

```python
from bioopti.reaction_simulator import simulate_reaction_rate

# Simulate an enzyme-catalyzed reaction
rate = simulate_reaction_rate(
    substrate_conc=2.5,    # [S] in mM
    vmax=1.8,              # Vmax in µmol/min
    km=0.5,                # Km in mM
    pH=6.8,                # current pH
    temp=35.0,             # current temperature °C
    optimal_pH=7.0,        # enzyme's optimal pH
    optimal_temp=37.0,     # enzyme's optimal temperature
    pH_sigma=1.0,          # pH tolerance
    temp_sigma=5.0,        # temperature tolerance
    inhibitor_conc=0.1,    # inhibitor concentration [I] in mM
    ki=0.05                # inhibition constant Ki in mM
)

print(f"Simulated reaction rate: {rate:.2f} µmol/min")
```
