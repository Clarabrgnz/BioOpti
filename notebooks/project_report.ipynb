    "# 1. Introduction üìö\n",
    "### ü§î What is BioOpti ?\n",
    "**BioOpti** is a Python-based toolkit designed to assist researchers, students, and professionals in optimizing biochemical processes. It provides modules for **culture media optimization** and **enzyme reaction simulations**.\n",
    "This project was developed as part of a programming course and integrates concepts from biochemistry, modeling, and software engineering to create a functional and flexible tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goals are to:\n",
    "- Optimize culture media composition by identifying, through the BACDive database, documented media that support optimal growth conditions for specific bacterial strains.\n",
    "- Simulate  and optimize enzymatic reaction rates considering parameters like substrate concentration, temperature, pH, and competitive inhibition."

    "# 2. Project Functionality Overview üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "BioOpti is organized as a modular Python package located in the `src/bioopti/` folder. Each module handles a specific task: culture medium optimization or enzymatic reaction simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß´ `media_optimizer.py`: Retrieves and displays documented bacterial culture media using the BACDive API\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîß Key Functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Authentication**: Connects to the BACdive database using user-provided credentials, ensuring secure access to microbial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strain Querying**:\n",
    "  - Allows users to search for bacterial strains using a taxonomic name (e.g., `Escherichia coli`).\n",
    "  - Automatically detects and supports both genus/species searches and direct strain ID queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Culture Media Retrieval**:\n",
    "  - Retrieves all available culture media recipes for the specified strain, enabling optimization by identifying media that are most appropriate for supporting its growth.\n",
    "  - Extracts detailed media compositions, including:\n",
    "    - Media name\n",
    "    - Reported growth performance\n",
    "    - Composition\n",
    "    - Link to official BACDive entry (if provided)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Growth Condition Extraction**:\n",
    "  - Retrieves and displays the optimal growth temperature for a bacterial strain.\n",
    "  - Applies a robust extraction method to identify the best temperature, including:\n",
    "    - Direct temperature entries (e.g., `37¬∞C`)\n",
    "    - Calculated average for temperature ranges (e.g., `20‚Äì30¬∞C`)\n",
    "    - Prioritizes ‚Äúoptimum‚Äù or ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù conditions for accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Console Visualization**:\n",
    "  - Presents the retrieved media recipes in a rich-formatted table using the `rich` library\n",
    "  - Color-coded columns for enhanced readability (media name, growth, composition, and temperature)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Handling**:\n",
    "  - Provides clear, descriptive error messages for:\n",
    "    - Strains not found in the database\n",
    "    - Missing media information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß† Purpose and Motivation:\n",
    "This module enables efficient exploration of bacterial culture conditions by identifying documented media that support the growth of specific bacteria, facilitating the identification of suitable media and growth conditions for diverse strains. Accessing media preparations that are already known, based on previous studies, helps reduce unnecessary experimental testing in the lab and supports faster, more reliable decisions in biochemistry and life sciences researches.\n",

    "### üî¨ `reaction_simulator.py`: Simulates and optimizes enzymatic reaction rates using a modified Michaelis-Menten model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîß Key Functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Loading**: Loads enzyme-specific kinetic parameters from a local JSON file, including:\n",
    "  - `km` : Michaelis constant\n",
    "  - `vmax`: Maximum velocity\n",
    "  - `Optimal pH` and `Optimal temperature`\n",
    "  - `pH tolerance` and `temprature tolerance`\n",
    "  - `ki`: Inhibition constant, if available\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Normalization**: Ensures consistent key formats by mapping unit-tagged keys to standard ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reaction Simulation**: Computes the enzymatic reaction rate with:\n",
    "  - Michaelis-Menten kinetics\n",
    "  - Gaussian penalties for deviation from optimal pH and temperature\n",
    "  - Optional adjustment for competitive inhibition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-Step Simulation**: The `simulate_from_local_data` function combines data fetching and rate calculation based on user-defined conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Uses the `differential_evolution` algorithm to find optimal Substrate concentration, pH and Temperature that maximize the enzymatic reaction rate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß† Purpose and Motivation:\n",
    "This module enables rational design and optimization of enzymatic reactions under varying biochemical and environmental constraints. Enzymes rarely operate under ideal conditions, so simulating and optimizing their behavior in silico helps design biochemical processes that are faster, cheaper, and more precise."

    "\n",
    "üß´ `media_optimizer`:\n",
    "- **Incomplete Media Information**: Some strains in the BACdive database lack complete media compositions or optimal growth conditions. This can limit the usefulness of the retrieved data.\n",
    "- **Variable Data Formats**: The media information can be stored in various formats (lists, nested dictionaries), requiring robust parsing methods to ensure consistent extraction.\n",
    "- **Temperature Extraction Complexity**: Identifying the optimal growth temperature is not always straightforward, as it can appear in multiple fields with varying formats (e.g., `20-30¬∞C`, `Optimum 37¬∞C`).\n",
    "\n",
    "üî¨ `reaction_simulator`:\n",
    "-  **Database limitations**: Our initial aim was to retrieve enzyme kinetic parameters directly from public databases such as SABIO-RK or BRENDA. However, many entries lacked critical kinetic details (e.g. inhibitor constants, pH/temperature ranges, or substrate-specific Km and Vmax values). Due to this incompleteness, we ultimately decidd to rely on a local dataset to ensure the robustness and reproducibility of our simulations.\n",
    "- **Simplified kinetics**: We used a modified Michaelis-Menten model with Gaussian penalties for pH and temperature. While this provides useful approximations, it doesn‚Äôt capture complex regulatory mechanisms (e.g. allosteric effects, cooperativity).\n",
    "- **Estimated values**: Parameters like `ph_sigma`, `temp_sigma`, and `ki` had to be approximated, since such data is not always available. This can impact the accuracy of the simulations.\n",
    "- **Lack of Iterative Learning**: The optimization is one-shot and static meaning there‚Äôs no adaptive feedback loop that could incorporate new experimental data or refine predictions based on real outcomes, as you might have in an active learning system.\n",
    "- **Single-substrate assumption**: The current model handles only single-substrate reactions. Multi-substrate and cofactor-dependent models are not yet implemented.\n",

    "- **Authenticated access to BACdive**: BACDive is a very large database. Accessing its API requires a secure authentication process using user-specific credentials to retrieve a token. This added complexity to the implementation.\n",
    "- **Server availability issues**: Since BACdive is hosted on a remote server, it may occasionally be under maintenance or experience downtime. During such periods, requests to the API fail, which can interrupt the functionality of `media_optimizer.py`.\n",

    "- Our work was divided across several key components, including package infrastructure, data loading, module and test development, report writing, as well as simulation and optimization. Maintaining a clear repository structure and committing frequently enabled effective collaboration and coordination throughout the project.\n",
    "- Writing clean interfaces between modules allowed each team member to focus on their part without breaking the others‚Äô work.\n",

    "### üîç What We Achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python-based toolkit for optimizing biochemical processes has been developed: \n",
    "- The media optimization module assesses growth conditions by analyzing nutrient composition and environmental factors, helping identify formulations that promote optimal microbial growth or specific biological outcomes. \n",
    "- The enzyme reaction module applies a modified Michaelis-Menten framework with Gaussian penalties to simulate the effects of pH and temperature on reaction rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the toolkit currently uses simplified models and fixed data, it already offers practical functionality for biochemical analysis. Future work will focus on expanding its biological scope, improving flexibility in media design and enhancing enzyme modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üôå Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a valuable learning experience that went beyond implementing an optimization algorithm. We gained a deeper understanding of how to interact with biological databases, an ambitious idea that proved more complex than expected due to incomplete and inconsistent entries. Collaborating on GitHub taught us the value of a clean repository structure, frequent commits, and clearly divided tasks. We designed each module to offer practical, reusable functions, which reinforced the importance of writing maintainable and meaningful code, reinforcing good coding practices. This project also helped us understand how real-world software is structured, tested, and deployed. While some of our initial ideas had to be adapted due to technical limitations, facing these obstacles helped us grow as developers."
